# Evaluating New LLMs: Why It's Getting Harder and What to Do

In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, new large language models (LLMs) emerge almost weekly, each promising breakthroughs in reasoning, creativity, or efficiency. But how do we reliably assess their true capabilities? This post explores why evaluating these models is becoming increasingly difficult amid rapid advancements, and offers practical strategies—including custom tests and essential tools—to navigate the benchmarking landscape. Why does this matter? Without robust evaluation, we risk deploying unreliable AI systems that could falter in real-world applications.

## Why It's Getting Harder

The explosion of LLM development has outpaced our ability to evaluate them effectively. Traditional benchmarks, once reliable yardsticks, now struggle to keep up with models that evolve at breakneck speed. For instance, as models grow larger and more sophisticated, evaluation frameworks face scalability issues, particularly with behemoths like GPT-4 successors that boast billions of parameters.<grok-card data-id="0dea5c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What happens when a benchmark designed for yesterday's AI meets tomorrow's giant?

### Rapid Releases and Benchmark Saturation

One core challenge is the sheer velocity of new model releases. In 2025 alone, we've seen dozens of iterations from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, each tweaking architectures or training data. This rapid cycle leads to "benchmark saturation," where models achieve near-perfect scores on established tests like MMLU or Hellaswag, rendering them less discriminative.<grok-card data-id="030c0a" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Older benchmarks become outdated quickly, as models overfit to publicly available test sets through contamination—data leaking into training corpora unintentionally.<grok-card data-id="1f2169" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Imagine training for a marathon only to find the course has changed overnight; evaluators must constantly adapt.

Moreover, performance varies wildly across tasks. A model excelling in coding might flop in reasoning or factual accuracy, complicating holistic assessments.<grok-card data-id="eb075d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> This task-specific variability demands more nuanced approaches, but with releases accelerating, keeping evaluations current feels like chasing a moving target.

### Biases, Inconsistencies, and Subjectivity

Human evaluation, long the gold standard, grapples with repeatability and inherent biases.<grok-card data-id="813057" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Evaluators might favor LLM-generated text over human-written content, introducing systematic skews.<grok-card data-id="ecee09" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> LLMs themselves, when used as judges, exhibit inconsistencies—producing different scores for identical inputs across runs.<grok-card data-id="98cffb" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Why trust an AI evaluator that's as fickle as the models it assesses?

Subjectivity compounds this: Metrics like "helpfulness" or "creativity" lack objective anchors, leading to debates over what constitutes success.<grok-card data-id="623c71" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> In high-stakes domains like medicine or law, where precision is paramount, these flaws could have real consequences.<grok-card data-id="81d373" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Non-determinism in generative AI adds another layer, as outputs vary even with fixed prompts.<grok-card data-id="f42768" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> These issues highlight a broader crisis: Our tools for measurement aren't evolving as fast as the tech they measure.

### Exploitation and Reliability Gaps

Recent research uncovers vulnerabilities, such as LLMs failing on novel tasks or being tricked into harmful outputs by adversaries.<grok-card data-id="705039" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Fairness and bias remain persistent headaches, with models perpetuating societal inequities unless rigorously tested.<grok-card data-id="574e99" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> As multimodal capabilities grow—handling text, images, and more—evaluation must expand beyond words, yet many benchmarks lag in this integration.

## Strategies for Benchmarking: Custom Tests

To counter these hurdles, shift from off-the-shelf benchmarks to tailored evaluations. Custom tests allow you to probe specific use cases, ensuring relevance to your needs. But how do you build them without reinventing the wheel?

### Designing Effective Custom Evaluations

Start with a clear framework: Define your objectives, such as assessing reasoning in domain-specific scenarios.<grok-card data-id="f9c5a7" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Create datasets that mimic real-world inputs, avoiding contamination by sourcing fresh data. For example, craft prompts testing edge cases like ambiguous queries or adversarial attacks.

Leverage LLMs themselves for evaluation—use one model to score another's outputs against golden responses for nuanced feedback.<grok-card data-id="bfb59a" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> This "LLM-as-judge" approach scales better than human review, though mitigate biases by averaging multiple runs. Incorporate metrics like BLEU for similarity or custom rubrics for qualitative traits.

### Examples and Best Practices

Consider building internal benchmarks for your application, like a set of 100+ queries tailored to customer service or code generation.<grok-card data-id="550efe" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Test for consistency by running evaluations multiple times and analyzing variance. Tools like DeepEval can help enforce JSON-structured outputs for easy parsing.<grok-card data-id="7119c0" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Pro tip: Combine offline (pre-deployment) and online (user feedback) testing for comprehensive insights.<grok-card data-id="263c45" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What if your custom test reveals a model's weakness in long-context reasoning? Iterate by fine-tuning or selecting alternatives.

## Tools for Evaluation

A robust toolkit is essential for efficient benchmarking. Here's a curated selection of 2025's top options, each addressing different facets of LLM assessment.

### Standardized Benchmarks and Platforms

Evidently AI offers over 30 benchmarks, from MMLU for knowledge to Chatbot Arena for conversational prowess, with easy integration links.<grok-card data-id="9076f6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> LiveBench stands out for its contamination-resistant design, generating fresh questions monthly to keep tests dynamic.<grok-card data-id="b9bf19" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

For agentic behaviors, AgentBench evaluates LLMs in interactive environments, simulating real tasks like planning or tool use.<grok-card data-id="1819bd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Deepchecks provides a user-friendly interface for comprehensive checks, ideal for teams building custom workflows.<grok-card data-id="bbac7d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Patronus AI emphasizes systematic testing with strategies for reliability.<grok-card data-id="38ac7d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> These tools collectively enable scalable, automated evals—crucial as models balloon in size.

## Future Challenges

Looking ahead, AI evaluation will grapple with even thornier issues. As models achieve superhuman feats, benchmarks must evolve to prevent overfitting and capture true generalization.<grok-card data-id="ddf37f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Ethical considerations, like ensuring fairness in multimodal systems, will demand new protocols.<grok-card data-id="df44f8" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Automated tools promise relief, but governance remains key—robust evals are hard to implement without standardized policies.<grok-card data-id="96524f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> In agentic AI, where models act autonomously, evaluation shifts to real-time monitoring for misuse or hallucinations.<grok-card data-id="7b1e98" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What safeguards will we need as AI integrates deeper into workplaces and societies?

Emerging trends include sovereign AI for data privacy and physical embodiments, each introducing unique assessment hurdles.<grok-card data-id="a0dfbd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Scalability with trillion-parameter models will test computational limits, pushing for efficient, distributed eval systems.

## Conclusion

Evaluating new LLMs is tougher than ever due to rapid advancements, biases, and outdated tools, but strategies like custom tests and platforms such as LiveBench or Deepchecks offer a path forward.
