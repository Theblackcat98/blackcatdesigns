# Evaluating New LLMs: Why It's Getting Harder and What to Do

In the fast-paced world of artificial intelligence, new large language models (LLMs) emerge almost weekly, each promising breakthroughs in reasoning, creativity, or efficiency. But how do we reliably assess their true capabilities? This post explores why evaluating these models is becoming increasingly difficult amid rapid advancements, and offers practical strategies—including custom tests and essential tools—to navigate the benchmarking landscape. Why does this matter? Without robust evaluation, we risk deploying unreliable AI systems that could falter in real-world applications.

## Why It's Getting Harder

The explosion of LLM development has outpaced our ability to evaluate them effectively. Traditional benchmarks, once reliable yardsticks, now struggle to keep up with models that evolve at breakneck speed. For instance, as models grow larger and more sophisticated, evaluation frameworks face scalability issues, particularly with behemoths like GPT-4 successors that boast billions of parameters.<grok-card data-id="0dea5c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What happens when a benchmark designed for yesterday's AI meets tomorrow's giant?

### Rapid Releases and Benchmark Saturation

One core challenge is the sheer velocity of new model releases. In 2025 alone, we've seen dozens of iterations from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, each tweaking architectures or training data. This rapid cycle leads to "benchmark saturation," where models achieve near-perfect scores on established tests like MMLU or Hellaswag, rendering them less discriminative.<grok-card data-id="030c0a" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Older benchmarks become outdated quickly, as models overfit to publicly available test sets through contamination—data leaking into training corpora unintentionally.<grok-card data-id="1f2169" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Imagine training for a marathon only to find the course has changed overnight; evaluators must constantly adapt.

Moreover, performance varies wildly across tasks. A model excelling in coding might flop in reasoning or factual accuracy, complicating holistic assessments.<grok-card data-id="eb075d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> This task-specific variability demands more nuanced approaches, but with releases accelerating, keeping evaluations current feels like chasing a moving target.

### Biases, Inconsistencies, and Subjectivity

Human evaluation, long the gold standard, grapples with repeatability and inherent biases.<grok-card data-id="813057" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Evaluators might favor LLM-generated text over human-written content, introducing systematic skews.<grok-card data-id="ecee09" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> LLMs themselves, when used as judges, exhibit inconsistencies—producing different scores for identical inputs across runs.<grok-card data-id="98cffb" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Why trust an AI evaluator that's as fickle as the models it assesses?

Subjectivity compounds this: Metrics like "helpfulness" or "creativity" lack objective anchors, leading to debates over what constitutes success.<grok-card data-id="623c71" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> In high-stakes domains like medicine or law, where precision is paramount, these flaws could have real consequences.<grok-card data-id="81d373" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Non-determinism in generative AI adds another layer, as outputs vary even with fixed prompts.<grok-card data-id="f42768" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> These issues highlight a broader crisis: Our tools for measurement aren't evolving as fast as the tech they measure.

### Exploitation and Reliability Gaps

Recent research uncovers vulnerabilities, such as LLMs failing on novel tasks or being tricked into harmful outputs by adversaries.<grok-card data-id="705039" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Fairness and bias remain persistent headaches, with models perpetuating societal inequities unless rigorously tested.<grok-card data-id="574e99" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> As multimodal capabilities grow—handling text, images, and more—evaluation must expand beyond words, yet many benchmarks lag in this integration.

## Strategies for Benchmarking: Custom Tests

To counter these hurdles, shift from off-the-shelf benchmarks to tailored evaluations. Custom tests allow you to probe specific use cases, ensuring relevance to your needs. But how do you build them without reinventing the wheel?

### Designing Effective Custom Evaluations

Start with a clear framework: Define your objectives, such as assessing reasoning in domain-specific scenarios.<grok-card data-id="f9c5a7" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Create datasets that mimic real-world inputs, avoiding contamination by sourcing fresh data. For example, craft prompts testing edge cases like ambiguous queries or adversarial attacks.

Leverage LLMs themselves for evaluation—use one model to score another's outputs against golden responses for nuanced feedback.<grok-card data-id="bfb59a" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> This "LLM-as-judge" approach scales better than human review, though mitigate biases by averaging multiple runs. Incorporate metrics like BLEU for similarity or custom rubrics for qualitative traits.

### Examples and Best Practices

Consider building internal benchmarks for your application, like a set of 100+ queries tailored to customer service or code generation.<grok-card data-id="550efe" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Test for consistency by running evaluations multiple times and analyzing variance. Tools like DeepEval can help enforce JSON-structured outputs for easy parsing.<grok-card data-id="7119c0" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Pro tip: Combine offline (pre-deployment) and online (user feedback) testing for comprehensive insights.<grok-card data-id="263c45" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What if your custom test reveals a model's weakness in long-context reasoning? Iterate by fine-tuning or selecting alternatives.

## Tools for Evaluation

A robust toolkit is essential for efficient benchmarking. Here's a curated selection of 2025's top options, each addressing different facets of LLM assessment.

### Standardized Benchmarks and Platforms

Evidently AI offers over 30 benchmarks, from MMLU for knowledge to Chatbot Arena for conversational prowess, with easy integration links.<grok-card data-id="9076f6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> LiveBench stands out for its contamination-resistant design, generating fresh questions monthly to keep tests dynamic.<grok-card data-id="b9bf19" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

For agentic behaviors, AgentBench evaluates LLMs in interactive environments, simulating real tasks like planning or tool use.<grok-card data-id="1819bd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Deepchecks provides a user-friendly interface for comprehensive checks, ideal for teams building custom workflows.<grok-card data-id="bbac7d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

### Specialized and Scalable Tools

NVIDIA's GenAI-Perf focuses on inference benchmarking, measuring speed and efficiency for deployment scenarios.<grok-card data-id="fb5905" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Confident AI delivers open-source implementations for bird's-eye evaluations, including metrics and datasets.<grok-card data-id="44c318" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> For materials science or niche domains, MatTools offers standardized frameworks to adapt benchmarks.<grok-card data-id="40c56c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Patronus AI emphasizes systematic testing with strategies for reliability.<grok-card data-id="38ac7d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> These tools collectively enable scalable, automated evals—crucial as models balloon in size.

## Future Challenges

Looking ahead, AI evaluation will grapple with even thornier issues. As models achieve superhuman feats, benchmarks must evolve to prevent overfitting and capture true generalization.<grok-card data-id="ddf37f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Ethical considerations, like ensuring fairness in multimodal systems, will demand new protocols.<grok-card data-id="df44f8" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

Automated tools promise relief, but governance remains key—robust evals are hard to implement without standardized policies.<grok-card data-id="96524f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> In agentic AI, where models act autonomously, evaluation shifts to real-time monitoring for misuse or hallucinations.<grok-card data-id="7b1e98" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> What safeguards will we need as AI integrates deeper into workplaces and societies?

Emerging trends include sovereign AI for data privacy and physical embodiments, each introducing unique assessment hurdles.<grok-card data-id="a0dfbd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Scalability with trillion-parameter models will test computational limits, pushing for efficient, distributed eval systems.

## Conclusion

Evaluating new LLMs is tougher than ever due to rapid advancements, biases, and outdated tools, but strategies like custom tests and platforms such as LiveBench or Deepchecks offer a path forward. By designing tailored benchmarks and leveraging automated evaluators, we can better discern model strengths and weaknesses. As AI evolves, staying curious about these challenges ensures we build trustworthy systems. What innovative eval method will you try next?

# The Evolution of System Prompts for Deep Research Agents

System prompts—those foundational instructions that guide AI behavior—have come a long way since the dawn of generative models. In 2025, they're no longer mere directives but intricate scaffolds enabling deep research agents to autonomously explore, synthesize, and verify knowledge. What started as basic commands in GPT-1 has evolved into dynamic, tool-integrated chains that power tools like OpenWebUI. Why does this matter? As AI agents tackle complex queries, well-crafted prompts determine whether outputs are insightful or illusory. This post unpacks the journey, key innovations, persistent hurdles, and ways to experiment forward.

## From Zero-Shot Whispers to Chained Reasoning: A Historical Arc

### The Dawn of Prompting in Early GPTs (2018–2021)
OpenAI's GPT-1 in 2018 introduced the transformer decoder for text generation, but prompts were rudimentary: simple continuations like "Complete this sentence." GPT-2 (2019) added scale, handling zero-shot tasks—predicting outputs without examples—but outputs often wandered into incoherence. By GPT-3 (2020), few-shot prompting emerged: embedding examples in prompts to generalize tasks like translation or summarization. These were static, one-off instructions, limited by the model's inability to "think" step-by-step. Early users hacked creativity with tricks like role-playing ("You are a helpful assistant"), but hallucinations—fabricated facts—plagued results. What if prompts could guide reasoning, not just recall?

### The Instruct Era and RLHF Refinement (2022–2024)
ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, powered by GPT-3.5 with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), marked a pivot. System prompts now enforced alignment: "Respond concisely and truthfully." This reduced chaos, but complex tasks still faltered. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in 2023—appending "Think step by step"—boosted arithmetic and logic by 20–50% on benchmarks. GPT-4 (2023) integrated multimodal inputs, with prompts specifying formats like JSON for structured outputs. Yet, as agents like Auto-GPT (2023) emerged, prompts needed recursion: self-generating sub-instructions for multi-step workflows. The era's lesson? Prompts must mimic human cognition to scale beyond chit-chat.

### 2025: Agents Awaken with Structured Chains
By mid-2025, GPT-5's release fused reasoning models (e.g., o3) with routers that auto-select fast or deep modes based on prompt complexity. Prompts now orchestrate agentic flows: decomposing queries into subtasks, invoking tools, and iterating outputs. In OpenWebUI, a open-source interface for local LLMs, prompts drive "Deep Research" functions—autonomous agents that plan queries, fetch via APIs, and synthesize cited reports. Unlike static RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), these chains enable long-horizon planning: parallel searches, memory pruning, and self-verification. The result? Agents that don't just answer—they investigate.

## Core Building Blocks: Role, Tools, and Multi-Turn Flows

### Role-Playing: Assigning Agency
Effective prompts begin with persona: "You are an elite research analyst with deep domain knowledge in science and finance." This anchors behavior, reducing drift. In 2025 agents, roles extend to multi-agent systems: one for query decomposition, another for synthesis. Why? It mirrors human teams, distributing cognitive load.

### Tool-Calling Syntax: From Text to Action
Modern prompts embed XML-like syntax for tools: `<tool>web_search(query="AI ethics 2025")</tool>`. OpenWebUI's functions parse these for DuckDuckGo integration or code execution. GPT-5's router enhances this, dynamically chaining tools based on context. Prompts specify outputs: "Return JSON with {sources: [], summary: ''}."

### Multi-Turn Flows: Chaining for Depth
Prompt chaining breaks tasks into pipelines: output of one feeds the next. Example in OpenWebUI for "Use web search then summarize":

1. **Step 1 Prompt**: "Decompose query '{user_query}' into 3 sub-queries. Output: JSON array."
2. **Step 2 (Parallel)**: For each sub-query, "Search web: {sub_query}. Extract top 3 facts with URLs."
3. **Step 3**: "Synthesize facts into a 200-word summary. Cite sources inline."

This yields verifiable reports, as in GPT Researcher's STORM multi-agent setup. What happens if a chain loops? It risks inefficiency—hence, prompts cap iterations: "Max 5 turns or conclude."

#### Pro Tip: Embed Error Handling
Add: "If data is insufficient, flag and suggest refinements." This builds resilience.

## Taming the Beast: Hallucination Mitigation Challenges

Even advanced chains falter. Hallucinations—confident fabrications—affect 20–50% of outputs in knowledge tasks. In 2025, causes include training incentives rewarding fluency over truth, plus long-context dilution.

Mitigations via prompts:
- **Grounding**: "Base responses only on provided sources. If uncertain, say 'Insufficient data'."
- **Self-Check**: CoT with verification: "After drafting, cross-reference facts against sources."
- **Structured Outputs**: Enforce tables for claims: "| Claim | Source | Confidence |".

| Technique | Example Prompt Snippet | Impact on Hallucinations |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Chain-of-Verification** | "Generate claim → Retrieve evidence → Revise if mismatch." | Reduces by 30% in RAG setups |
| **Abstention Allowance** | "If <70% confident, abstain and explain." | Cuts overconfidence by 40% |
| **Few-Shot Grounding** | Include verified examples: "Query: X → Facts: Y (cite Z)." | Boosts factual recall 25% |

Yet challenges persist: Multilingual biases amplify in global agents, and compute costs soar for iterative checks. Why does this endure? LLMs optimize for coherence, not veracity—prompts alone can't fully rewrite incentives.

## Community Wisdom: Best Practices from GitHub Repos

Open-source thrives on shared prompts. Repos like dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide offer notebooks for CoT and RAG tuning. dontriskit/awesome-ai-system-prompts curates agentic examples, emphasizing domain rules: "For research: Prioritize peer-reviewed sources; format as Markdown with citations."

Key practices:
- **Modularity**: Use templates with variables: "Research {topic} using {tool}."
- **Iteration**: Version prompts via diffs, testing on benchmarks.
- **Safety**: Embed ethics: "Avoid bias; flag uncertainties."

From x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools, Claude Code's prompt stresses "Research-first: Verify before acting." Communities like Reddit's r/OpenWebUI share Deep Research tweaks, blending prompts with functions for verifiable outputs.

## Dynamic Horizons: Experiments with Variables

To future-proof, infuse variability. In OpenWebUI, custom variables turn prompts into templates: "{num_queries:3} sub-searches on {topic}, temperature {temp:0.7}." LangChain's expression language enables runtime injection: Pull schemas dynamically for graph RAG.

**Experiment Ideas**:
1. **A/B Testing**: Chain with/without variables; measure hallucination via self-scores.
2. **Adaptive Temperature**: "If {complexity:high}, set temp=0.2 for precision."
3. **Few-Shot Retrieval**: Dynamically fetch examples: "Retrieve 2 similar queries from DB."

Try in OpenWebUI: Load a Deep Research model, vary {max_iterations:2–5}, and log synthesis quality. What emerges? Prompts that evolve with data, not just users.

## Final Thoughts: Prompts as the Soul of Agency
From GPT-1's raw predictions to 2025's autonomous researchers, system prompts have scripted AI's ascent—chaining thought, tools, and verification into something profoundly capable. Yet, as agents like those in OpenWebUI probe deeper, the real evolution lies in our stewardship: crafting prompts that prioritize truth over fluency. We've mitigated hallucinations, but can we instill curiosity that questions its own chains? Experiment boldly—your next variable might unlock the uncharted. What's one prompt tweak you'll test today?

# Essential Design Principles

Good design is invisible. When done right, users don't notice the thoughtful decisions behind it—they just enjoy the experience. Let's explore the key principles that make design work.

## 1. Simplicity

The best designs are often the simplest ones. Remove unnecessary elements and focus on what matters.

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Leonardo da Vinci

When you strip away the unnecessary, you're left with the essential. This principle applies to:

- **Visual hierarchy** - Guide the user's attention
- **Navigation** - Make it obvious how to move through your design
- **Content** - Use clear, concise language

## 2. Consistency

Users learn from patterns. When design elements behave consistently, users feel confident using your product.

Consistency includes:

- Visual consistency (colors, typography, spacing)
- Behavioral consistency (interactions work the same way)
- Conceptual consistency (ideas and patterns are unified)

## 3. Feedback & Visibility

Users need to understand the result of their actions. Every interaction should provide feedback.

Examples of good feedback:

1. Visual responses (button highlights, loading states)
2. Error messages that help, not confuse
3. Progress indicators for long operations
4. Confirmation messages for critical actions

## 4. Accessibility

Design for everyone. This means considering:

- Color contrast for readability
- Keyboard navigation support
- Alt text for images
- Clear focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

## 5. White Space

White space (or negative space) is not wasted space. It helps:

- Reduce cognitive load
- Create visual separation
- Improve readability
- Draw attention to key elements

## Conclusion

These principles form the foundation of great design. Apply them thoughtfully to create experiences that are beautiful, functional, and delightful.
